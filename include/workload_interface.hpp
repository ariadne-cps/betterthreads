//! \details E: stack element type
//!          AS: optional input arguments for processing the elements; if used as output, their synchronisation
//!              in the concurrent case is up to the designer
//!          The workload handles the non-concurrent case separately, in order to unroll the tasks breadth-first: if
//!          tasks were instead enqueued to the TaskManager, a depth-first execution would be performed.
